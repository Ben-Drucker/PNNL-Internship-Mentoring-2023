# PNNL-Internship-2023 💻

- See the ["roadmap"](https://github.com/users/Ben-Drucker/projects/4) for an overview of the project. 📆
  - _Note_: The start dates and due dates are not firm at all; rather, they are an estimate and designed to show the ordering of tasks. Don't feel like you need to work more hours than agreed upon to finish a given task by its "due date."
    - If you find (relevant) and interesting side tasks, feel free to explore those. (I'm trying to avoid micro-managing)
  - _Note_: This roadmap has additional views (Task List, Todo｜In Progress｜Done).
- Necessary files are located in the ["code"](https://github.com/Ben-Drucker/PNNL-Internship-2023) tab. 📁
- **Please feel free to ask questions if something doesn't make sense, you don't understand what something is asking to do, if something doesn't work, or if you need guidance on anything.**
