# PNNL-Internship-2023 💻

### Welcome!
- See the ["roadmap"](https://github.com/users/Ben-Drucker/projects/4) for an overview of the project. 📆
  - _Note_: The start dates and due dates are not firm at all; rather, they are an estimate and designed to show the ordering of tasks. Don't feel like you need to work more hours than agreed upon to finish a given task by its "due date."
    - If you find (relevant) and interesting side tasks, feel free to explore those. (I'm trying to avoid micro-managing)
  - _Note_: This roadmap has additional views (Task List, Todo｜In Progress｜Done).
- Necessary files are located in the ["code"](https://github.com/Ben-Drucker/PNNL-Internship-2023) tab. 📁
- **Please feel free to ask questions if something doesn't make sense, you don't understand what something is asking to do, if something doesn't work, or if you need guidance on anything.**
  - If I'm not immediately available, you can work on another issue (making sure to work on items for which you've met the dependencies)
  - If I'm not immediately available, and you've completed all the items you're capible of working on,   

### Goals

- 
- Take breaks! 

### Availability/Communication
- The availability indicator in Teams/Outlook (<img width="100px" src="https://github.com/Ben-Drucker/PNNL-Internship-2023/assets/66132763/d40c9dcb-0d47-4fdb-8448-16ac6cc0b21e">) is generally accurate, but you may send me messages at any time (even if it says "do not disturb). However, my level of availability may impact how quickly I can get back to you. Sometimes I forget to change it. Here are the rest of the availability indicators:

- If you want to call, I would appreciate if you could send me a chat with "Can we call?" or something, just so I have a minute to set up my camera/audio, remove distracting backgrounds, etc.
