# PNNL-Internship-2023 💻

- See the ["roadmap"](https://github.com/users/Ben-Drucker/projects/4) for an overview of the project. 📆
  - _Note_: The start dates and due dates are not firm at all; rather, they are an estimate and designed to show the ordering of tasks 🙂. Don't feel like you need to work more hours than agreed upon to finish a given task by it's "due date."
    - If you find (relevant) and interesting side tasks, feel free to explore those. (I'm trying to avoid micro-managing 🙂)
  - _Note_: This roadmap has additional views (Task List, Todo｜In Progress｜Done).
- Necessary files are located in the ["code"](https://github.com/Ben-Drucker/PNNL-Internship-2023) tab. 📁
