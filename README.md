# PNNL-Internship-2023 üíª

### Welcome!
- See the ["roadmap"](https://github.com/users/Ben-Drucker/projects/4) for an overview of the project. üìÜ
  - _Note_: The start dates and due dates are not firm at all; rather, they are an estimate and designed to show the ordering of tasks. Don't feel like you need to work more hours than agreed upon to finish a given task by its "due date."
    - If you find (relevant) and interesting side tasks, feel free to explore those. (I'm trying to avoid micro-managing)
  - _Note_: This roadmap has additional views (Task List, TodoÔΩúIn ProgressÔΩúDone).
- Necessary files are located in the ["code"](https://github.com/Ben-Drucker/PNNL-Internship-2023) tab. üìÅ
- **Please feel free to ask questions if something doesn't make sense, you don't understand what something is asking to do, if something doesn't work, or if you need guidance on anything.**
  - If I'm not immediately available, you can work on another issue (making sure to work on items for which you've met the dependencies)
  - If I'm not immediately available, and you've completed all the items you're capible of working on, do the following: 
    - Work on a side-project of your choice in the field of machine learning. Think of a topic you're interested in or find some ideas on Google/Chat GPT. Start a new Jupyter Notebook(s) in a new folder, and incorporate (at least) the [`sklearn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) ‚Äî for non-deep-learning projects or [`torch`](https://pytorch.org/) libraries ‚Äî for deep learning projects.

### Goals

- Understand the development process for a deep learning program, and especially how Git and Github/Gitlab aids in organizing progress.
- Understand the biological goal of our machine learning project.
- Understand the steps involved in deep learning (e.g., data preprocessing, training, evaluating, etc.)
- Understand an existing codebase and be able to assist in organizing, formalizing, and documentation.
- Be able to use/understand UNIX and use it on local and remote (high performance computing) machines.
- Become famililar with deep learning/machine learning theory, and be able to create/edit custom deep learning architectures in Pytorch.
- Be able to update others articulately on your progress in a complex project.
- [Stretch goal] Improve the performance (accuracy) of the existing deep learning model through changes to our model's architecture
- Learn about other topics at PNNL from other individuals at the lab through [virtual events](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd11sr704.na1.hubspotlinks.com%2FCtc%2F2M%2B113%2Fd11Sr704%2FVVxtP-2ww3DLVMDZ6422LNJ5W8_npSB4_whH-N9cd5HX3q90JV1-WJV7CgNnFN4pX098HQk2zVVQmY74LpdZmVtz4j54rJ37YW4dVT486JCgchVlwfkY2Xk0bfW3_rw8Z2PTmVHW5M6SnY45V0HMW1yz5qV21b_s3N9cX2t4f4fQBW3vBqrT5dPrqDW4_Zphn5665pPW1nsKpq4qCWjLN82-5LYtSKgsW7whYXh7GGxWYVwKJlC1gv3KfW808T3_5KmjrmN30xCFdLJ9YqW8hMPrz4720VhW8dpYT9352Z3NW7Vxbk74X3phFW1V7WC883G4p4W2DVwzB43xyS0W5wn7xm32CVBRN2JS66lXPGwDW1vnY4-2YpVJQW3tr2v84_skPvW30vv8G907f1-W4DQNV744CyM73f1S1&data=05%7C01%7Cben.drucker%40pnnl.gov%7Cd7eaf1ecd62d487a99b108db678db9d9%7Cd6faa5f90ae240338c0130048a38deeb%7C0%7C0%7C638217630627033585%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=aE3HB0sFupPRIAzBHjFEgVmrZ%2FQu5EdGIl%2BJhwlQhcw%3D&reserved=0).
- Think about some goals you have, edit this readme, and put them below:
  - Goal 1...

- Take breaks!
- Have fun!

### Availability/Communication
- The availability indicator in Teams/Outlook (<img width="100px" src="https://github.com/Ben-Drucker/PNNL-Internship-2023/assets/66132763/d40c9dcb-0d47-4fdb-8448-16ac6cc0b21e">) is generally accurate, and you may send me messages at any time (even if it has the "Do Not Disturb" indicator). However, my level of availability may impact how quickly I can get back to you. Sometimes I forget to change it. Here are the rest of the availability indicators:

- If you want to call, I would appreciate if you could send me a chat with "Can we call?" or something, just so I have a minute to set up my camera/audio, remove distracting backgrounds, etc.
- I have times tentitively set up for daily/semi-weekly check in meetings. If those work, you can RSVP "available" to them individually.
- At the end of each week, let's plan to discuss how things went that week and if you'd prefer anything being done differently.
