In particular, make sure to use `pandas` [`pandas.to_datetime`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.to_datetime.html) to obtain [`pandas.Timestamp`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Timestamp.html) objects. This will make sorting easy. Do not manually implement a sorting function. Also do not implement a custom scheme to convert numerical dates to strings. Use [`strftime`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.dt.strftime.html) instead.\n",
